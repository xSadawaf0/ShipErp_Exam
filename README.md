After copying the repo to your local just migrate the database using "php artisan migrate:fresh"
        <br></br>
        * DONT FORGET TO ADJUST YOUR ENV FOR THE DATABASE
        <br></br>
    
After migrating the database you can now type "php artisan serve" then you may now access the project in your browser "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
